## Biased data example

This repository contains code resources to accompany our research paper,

>Variational inference for cutting feedback in misspecified models.

These codes are for the biased data example in Section 3.4 and 5.3.

Detailed steps to run the code are as follows.

- 1 Run [biased_data.py]. It will save [biased_marginal1.pdf] and [biased_marginal2.pdf] as Figure 2 in the paper. Besides, it will save [biased_contour.pdf] as Figure 3 in the paper.
- 2 Run [biased_data_conflict_check.py]. It will save [biased-data-conflict-check.pdf] as Figure 4 in the paper.
